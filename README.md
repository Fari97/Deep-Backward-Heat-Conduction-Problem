DeepBHCP: Deep neural network algorithm for solving backward heat conduction problems

This paper presents an application of a deep neural network method, a semi-supervised one to solve backward heat conduction problems which have been long-standing computational challenges due to being ill-posed.
‎The effectiveness and robustness of the methodology are demonstrated through various problems including different types of boundary conditions‎, ‎several types of time-dependent thermal diffusivity factors‎, ‎and a variety of domains for two-dimensional tests‎.‎
In spite of traditional methods, there is no need to apply any regularization technique.
‎According to simulation results‎, ‎this revolutionary strategy can efficiently and accurately extract the pattern of the solutions even when the noise corruption up to ten present is imposed on input data‎.
‎Moreover‎, ‎when we extend the final time point further‎, ‎this approach is efficient in recovering the data at the initial time‎, ‎which accentuates the method's robustness‎.‎
To demonstrate the superiority of the semi-supervised neural network process, we make a comparison with the radial basis functions finite difference (RBF-FD) method which is a localized RBF method.
